## <b>[Deep Reinforcement learning](https://phatcvo.github.io/Lec-DRL/)</b>

The goal of this document is to keep track the state-of-the-art in deep reinforcement learning. It starts with basics in reinforcement learning and deep learning to introduce the notations and covers different classes of deep RL methods, value-based or policy-based, model-free or model-based, etc.

Different classes of deep RL methods can be identified. This document will focus on the following ones:

Value-based algorithms (DQN…) used mostly for discrete problems like video games.
Policy-gradient algorithms (A3C, DDPG…) used for continuous control problems such as robotics.
Recurrent attention models (RAM…) for partially observable problems.
Model-based RL to reduce the sample complexity by incorporating a model of the environment.
Application of deep RL to robotics
One could extend the list and talk about hierarchical RL, inverse RL, imitation-based RL, etc…
